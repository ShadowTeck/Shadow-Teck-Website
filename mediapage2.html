      <p class="paragraph">Utopias consist of perfect societies. Dystopias consist of imbalanced and corrupt societies. That’s the definition of what we have for both of those opposite versions of sociatale view. But let's take a view into the type of literature they take place in.  In “The Giver” Jonas is transmitted memories by an old man which makes him see things and remember things nobody else in the world can. He can see colors, have vivid memories of things such as war and chaos, and can even learn about the past events that nobody in his entire community has access to. But one day he runs away from this all. He can not take the pain of  being in a utopian society with dystopian views. Another example of this is in “Fahrenheit 451” (which by the way is one of my all time favorites). Montag is exposed to literature in a very innocent way. He did not know what it was and did not know why people were willing to die for such useless objects he thought. But once Montag was enlightened to the view and impact of books, he no longer wanted to burn them. He was exposed to a more sensible reality then the dystopian world he lived in. The power of the book was more to him then he would have ever realized. Dystopian is a very odd term and to which I believe it becomes very satirical to our society. People strive to join an utopian society and work their whole lives to try and fit their own versions of a “utopian” lifestyle. But what most people aren’t getting is that they're only getting closer to a dystopian point of view.
</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This happens because they are not truly fulfilling themselves on what actually makes them happy. They ignore the true substances of life and only focus on temporary habits that make them feel good, and allow for their existence to only shorty live on it’s useless purpose. In the book “Brave New World” it conveys a similar message, along with plenty of other mixed messages. The savage known as John exploits the story’s utopian society by explaining that true fulfillment and “high arts” should be the peoples focus. But in Brave New World the civilization isn’t focused on such things. They strive to be genetically conditioned from a test tube to the day they die, only believing in drugs, parties, and sexual activities. They have no substance to life, and they miss out on the wonders of life itself. Now this video isn’t about how you shouldn’t go have fun and I’m not here to help you find your own personal fulfillment. I’m simply here to explain the power a dystopian society can have on individuals like you. The definitions of a true utopian and dystopian society are now blurred and it turns out to just be a product of human imagination. Utopian societies can not function with human awareness. Stability is the main goal for utopians, but yet they always have to sacrifice a basic human right or a natural law to keep this stability. Which that question itself may also make you question the true stability they truly withhold. Now that you can see the blurred definitions of utopian and dystopian, I can really show you the point I’m trying to make. What do these dystopian societies bring to us? Do they bring self awareness? Do they bring violence? Yes and yes. They do bring both of those, but they bring more to humans than just the obvious. They bring imagination. When we read dystopian or utopian books, the satirical value always allows for us to reflect. It brings us to a state of mind that no other object or idea in the world could bring us to. That’s why I describe it as a portal.
        </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;" class="paragraph">It can spark a creative spirit in the human imagination to let us look at the world with a certain, more specific view. These societies prompt you with the question of what society you want to live in. You can now look past the satire and find the true message behind and between the words on the printed pages of your novel. Enlightenment thinkers have forever changed the way literature would be written. They brought a certain amount of human awareness that gave a whole new meaning to how books would be written. Instead of just being factual and logical, humans found innovative and creative ways to express their questions and confront the world with issues they may have not even known existed. Another point I would like to make as well is how relatable the characters can be. Depending on the book, you can almost feel as if you were the character. You, as the reader, become just as lost and confused as the character itself. You can not make a perfectly accurate decision or prediction because the society is not alike yours and is so twisted in such a blurred way you don’t know how, why or even what’s going to happen. It is only when you open your thoughts and allow the message to convey itself, you will finally realize the story behind you, and the world you live in...</p>
